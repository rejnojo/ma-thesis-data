""wait… this is an ad??"" But I wasn’t even mad. It gave story, it gave emotion, it gave GLOW UP. The vibes were immaculate, and honestly? I added to cart before I even finished the video. ?? #influenced","OMG don’t even get me started—there was this one ad that was just... painful. It was like this dude screaming “BUY THIS NOW!!!” and throwing stuff around his room like a toddler on espresso. ?? No context, no chill, no aesthetic.  I sat there like ?? “sir, why are you yelling at me at 2 a.m.?” It felt like a used car salesman trapped inside a Gen Z cosplay. And the worst part? It kept popping up over and over again like it was haunting me. Repetitive and aggressive?? No thanks. Immediate skip, block, delete, spiritual cleanse."
